I am a 2nd year student at the University of East Anglia studying a degree in Business Information Systems. 

I aspire to work in cyber security going into the future, with interests in forensics, penetration testing, ethical hacking, networks. 

I created this blog as a way of contributing my thoughts to the information security community. 

### More Information

Outside of university studies, I like to get involved with the local tech commununity by attending meetups with organisations such as TechEast and the Norfolk and Suffolk Cyber Security Cluster.
