title: PII Scams Are Changing
---
PII (Personally Identifiable Information) refers to any data that can identify a specific person, such as addresses, phone numbers and Date of Birth. 

For a while now they have been a problem on social media platforms, where it is very easy to trick an individual into giving away their personal information. 

Users will create pages (often on Facebook) pretending to be another business or just a make/model of a product (e.g. a car), and will suck you in by creating a fake competition. These fake competitions often ask you to complete a survey to enter in for a draw to win a prize, or will pretend that a draw took place, but because the "winner" did not respond in time you can now be in with a chance of winning by liking, commenting and or sharing the post. 

However, I have recently noticed a trend where the scams are changing. As more and more users watch out for these scams and report them, scammers are looking to change how they dupe you into giving away your personal information. 

Instead of creating a fake competition from scratch, they will watch out for existing legitimate competitions that have been shared by users, comment on the post that the user has won and ask you to visit their profile. However, the way they get your information remains similar to the existing PII scams. There will be a post on their profile asking you to like, share the post and click on a link to fill in your details.  

But how can we spot if it is fake?

1. They will get in contact (comment on the shared post) before the legitimate draw has taken place. 
2. The grammar in their comments and posts will be poor. 
3. The post explaining what you need to do to claim your prize will mention multiple winners. Think back to the legitimate competition, did it mention multiple winners? If the prize is substantial, there is unlikely to be multiple winners, especially if the company doing the competition is small. 
4. They will ask you to like and share their post and fill in your personal details with a suspicious link. If you won, why would you need to like and share their post as well. It is also likely they would send you a private message, phone or email to get in contact and not request a form to be filled as the winner. 

How can you take action as a user? Make sure you report these fake accounts and let the legitimate business know they are being targeted by a scammer. At a time of increased uncertainty, it is ever more important we support businesses in any way we can.
